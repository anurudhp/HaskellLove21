Competitive Programming in Haskell
==================================

This is the repository for my talk at Haskell Love 2021.  Feel free to
clone it and play around.

To test a solution (on the provided test cases only), just `cd` into
the directory containing the Haskell code and run `python3
../test.py`.  Note that this does *not* test your solution against the
secret test data on the Kattis servers.  For that, you will have to
make a (free) account on https://open.kattis.com/ and submit it
yourself.
